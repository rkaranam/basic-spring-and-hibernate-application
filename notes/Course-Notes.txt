Primary functions of a Spring Container are

	1. Create and manage objects (Inversion of Control)
	2. Inject object's dependencies (Dependency Injection)

3 ways of configuring Spring Container
	
	1. XML Configuration File
	2. Java Annotations
	3. Java Source Code

Spring Development Process

	1. Configure your Spring Beans
	2. Create a Spring Container
	3. Retrieve your Spring Beans

Development Process - Constructor Injection

	1. Define the dependency interface and class
	2. Create a constructor in your class for injections
	3. Configure the dependency injection in Spring Configuration file

Developer Process - Setter Injection

	1. Create setter method(s) for injection
	2. Configure the setter injection in Spring Configuration file

Read values from a properties file

	1. Create Properties File
	2. Load Properties file in Spring Config file
	3. Reference values from Properties file

Bean Scopes:
	- Scope refers to the lifecycle of a bean
	- How long does the bean live?
	- How many instances are created?
	- How is the bean shared?

Bean Lifecycle:
	
	1. Container started
	2. Bean Instantiated
	3. Dependencies Injected
	4. Internal Spring Processing
	5. Your Custom Init Method
	6. Now, Bean is ready to use
	7. Container is shutdown
	8. Your Custom Destroy Method
	9. Stop

Hibernate Development Process

	1. Add Hibernate Configuration file
	2. Annotate Java Class
	3. Develop Java code to perform database operations

Hibernate Code through Java Process

	1. Create Session Factory
	2. Create Session from Session Factory
	3. Create Object to be saved to database
	4. Using session start a transaction
	5. Save the object/Read the object
	6. Commit the transaction
	
Querying Hibernate Objects

	1. Create Session Factory
	2. Create Session from Session Factory
	3. Build a query
	4. Execute it
	5. Display the result
	6. Commit the transaction

Hibernate CRUD Operations

	1. Create Objects
	2. Read Objects
	3. Update Objects
	4. Delete Objects	

Things to implement:
--------------------
1. Implement In-Memory database implementation using H2 or HSQL in Hibernate
